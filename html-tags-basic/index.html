        <!-- this is the coding block for your context in a paragraph tag
             a paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags

            <p>
                The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your
                displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT display your content
                in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your html file.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start
                a new line.
            </p>
            <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag)
            you would be in trouble using the tag
            instead: you can use special character strings to
            represent components of the tag such as the < (&lt;) and
            the > (&gt;) symbols-->
